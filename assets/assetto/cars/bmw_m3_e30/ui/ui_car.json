	"brand": "BMW",
	"description": "Based on the 1986 model year E30 3-Series, the E30 M3 used the BMW S14 four cylinder engine.The production of the E30 road car was to homologate the M3 for Group A Touring Car racing. <br/><br/>
	
	The Sport Evolution model production run of 600 (sometimes referred as EVO3) increased engine displacement to 2.5 L and produced 235 hp (175 kW). Sport Evolution models have enlarged front bumper openings and an adjustable multi-position front splitter and rear wing. Brake cooling ducts were installed in place of front foglights. An additional 786 convertibles were also produced.<br/><br/>
	
	To keep the car competitive in racing following year-to-year homologation rules changes, homologation specials were produced. Homologation (motorsport) rules roughly stated that the race version must reflect the street car aerodynamically and in engine displacement. These include: the Evo 1, Evo 2, and Sport Evolution some of which featured less weight, improved aerodynamics, taller front wheel arches (Sport Evolution; to further facilitate 18-inch (460 mm) wheels in DTM), brake ducting, and more power. Other limited-production models (based on evolution models but featuring special paintwork and/or unique interior schemes commemorating championship wins) include the Europa, Ravaglia, Cecotto, and Europameister. Production of the original E30 M3 ended in early 1992.",
